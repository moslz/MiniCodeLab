# Password Generator short script for fun. 

This is a simple password generator script written in Python. It allows you to generate passwords using either common words or random characters, based on your preference. 

## Features

- Generate passwords using common words or random characters.
- Customize the number of common words or the length of the password.

## Prerequisites

Python 3.x

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.

2. Ensure you have a file named `common_words.csv` in the same directory as the script. This file should contain a list of common words, each on a separate line.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.

4. Run the script by executing the following command:
   
   ```
   python password_generator.py
   ```

5. Follow the on-screen prompts to generate passwords.

## Usage

1. Choose between generating passwords using common words or random characters.

2. If choosing common words:
   - Enter the number of common words you want in your password (between 3 and 9).

3. If choosing random characters:
   - Enter the desired password length (minimum 8 characters).

4. The script will then generate and display the password.

5. Repeat the process to generate more passwords or exit the script.

## Notes

Make sure to keep the `common_words.csv` file updated with relevant common words.
