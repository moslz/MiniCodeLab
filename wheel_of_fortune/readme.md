# Wheel of Fortune Game

This project implements a simplified version of the classic game "Wheel of Fortune" in Python. It is a text-based game where players guess letters in a phrase to win prizes and money. 

## Game Rules

- Players guess letters in a phrase to reveal the hidden phrase.
- The game includes both human and computer players.
- Players spin a wheel to determine the prize amount for each turn.
- Players can guess individual letters, vowels (with a cost), or the entire phrase.
- The game continues until a player correctly guesses the complete phrase or all letters are revealed.

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the folder and run `wheel_of_fortune.py`.
3. make sure that two JSON files named `wheel.json` and `phrases.json` are in the same directory.
4. Modify the `wheel.json` file with the wheel prizes and types as you wish (or keep the original).
5. Populate the `phrases.json` file with different categories and phrases for the game (or use the original).
6. Run the Python script `wheel_of_fortune.py` to start the game.
7. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up the number of human and computer players.
8. Players take turns spinning the wheel and guessing letters or phrases.
9. The game announces winners and their prizes.
