# Unit Converter

The Unit Converter is a simple Python program with a couple of simple functions that allows you to convert various units. It is using a simple command-line interface for selecting the type of conversion and performing the conversion. 

## Conversions:

### Length Converter:

1. Meters (m) to Feet (ft)
2. Centimeters (cm) to Inches (in)
3. Kilometers (km) to Miles (mi)

### Temperature Converter:

1. Celsius (°C) to Fahrenheit (°F)
2. Celsius (°C) to Kelvin (K)

### Weight Converter:

1. Kilograms (kg) to Pounds (lb)
2. Grams (g) to Ounces (oz)

### Area Converter:

1. Square Meters (m²) to Square Feet (ft²)
2. Square Feet (ft²) to Square Meters (m²)

### Speed Converter:

1. Kilometers per Hour (km/h) to Miles per Hour (mph)
2. Miles per Hour (mph) to Kilometers per Hour (km/h)

## Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. Select the category of conversion you want to perform (1 to 5).
3. Choose the specific conversion within the category (1 to the number of conversions available in that category).
4. Enter the value you want to convert.
5. The program will display the converted value.

## Note:

While the current code provides a clear and functional way to perform unit conversions, it can be written more concisely and efficiently using a dictionary-based approach.
