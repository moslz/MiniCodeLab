Behavior Tree to NuSMV Model Encoder

Overview:

This Python program is designed to convert Behavior Trees, defined in an XML format, into corresponding NuSMV models. The tool processes the Behavior Tree, identifying the actions and their sequences or selectors, and then generates a NuSMV model that mirrors this structure.

Features:

Parses XML-based Behavior Trees.
Handles various node types in Behavior Trees, including Actions, Sequences, and Selectors.
Creates a NuSMV model with appropriate variable definitions and state transitions.

Requirements:

Python 3.x
XML Behavior Trees for Program Input.

Installation:

No additional installation is required, as the program uses the standard Python library.

Usage:

Prepare the Behavior Tree XML File: Create an XML file representing your Behavior Tree. The XML should follow the structure exemplified in the provided templates.

Run the Script: Execute the script with the XML file as input. The script will parse the Behavior Tree and generate a corresponding NuSMV model.

Input Format:

The Behavior Tree should be defined in XML format, with nested elements representing the tree's structure, including Actions, Sequences, and Selectors.

Example:

<root main_tree_to_execute="MainTree">
    <BehaviorTree ID="MainTree">
        <Sequence name="Root">
            <Action name="SomeAction"/>
        </Sequence>
    </BehaviorTree>
</root>

Output Format:

The output is a NuSMV model file, containing the NuSMV Model representation of the Behavior Tree. It includes state variables for each action and the transition logic.

Limitations:

The program assumes well-formed XML input.
