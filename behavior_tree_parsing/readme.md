# Behavior Tree Parser

A Python parser will be written to extract information from XML-formatted behavior trees. The goal is to parse behavior trees and generate natural language descriptions.

## Overview

The project aims to handle various structures of behavior trees encoded in XML. The parser can recognize standard nodes such as Sequence, Selector, Action, Condition, Parallel, Switch, and Root. Additionally, it attempts to handle nodes with custom names by extracting relevant information.

## Features

- Parses standard behavior tree structures.
- Handles custom-named nodes by extracting available information.
- Generates natural language descriptions of behavior trees.
